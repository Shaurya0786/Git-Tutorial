1. git init -> To Intianlize the functionality of git in a folder we have to use command , This intializzes a .git folder as a hidden folder in this repository
and this .git folder manages the functionality of git 

2.The Working of Git is divided into 3 Areas 
  
  1. `Working Area` -> This is the Area that holds Untraked Files and Folders and File that is in the Working Area is Not Tracked by git and 
  therefore Change Made in that are Not reflected in it 


  2.'Staging Area' -> This is the Area in which it is decided that which Change will go in the next commit and which will Not 
  so for example that there is a file you have and you staged that file with some changes now git will follow these changes and if the file is modified again while 
  it is in the staging Staging Area we will have to stage that file again as that changes are Not staged for the next commit  
     
     1. git add <fileName> -> to move a file from working area to Staging area
     
     2. git rm --cached <fileName> -> to unstage a file 
 

3.`Repository Area` -> This area keeps the version history of a particular file that and we can roll back to previous versions to see which change was made in each 
 version
