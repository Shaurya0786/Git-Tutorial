Stashing -> It is a feature of git where if we dont want a particular code to be there in the next commit and we dont want to the chnages to be deleted as they 
can be used in the future we can do is stash the file 

These things were Stashed before and the were added after unstashing
so what stashing does is it will remove the content that is stashed and get the file to the previous commit staged
we can stash multiple piece of code and it created a stash list 
There are various commands of stashing 
 
 1.git stash -> To stash some piece of code
 
 2.git stash apply -> gets the latest last stashed code to be applied and gets the file in working directory as modiefied
 
 3.git stash list -> we can get the list of that is stashed piece of code 

 4.git stash apply stash@{number} -> if we want to apply a particular stashed piece of code
